### Holle dear visitor ðŸ‘‹

Here in my repositories are code for my papers, courses with high score and competetions  
Hope you find them helpful ! ðŸ˜˜  

1. My paper **Self Sampling Meta SAM: Enhancing Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation with Meta-Learning** is accepted for WACV 2024! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤©
2. Built a SSH version of AlphaFold docker, if you can only stay in docker images on some AI GPU clusters, without rights to access Linux OS directly, this is a great resolution for you!
3. If you are attending **Wolrd Robot Contest - BCI Controlled Robot Contest** in MI track, [here](https://github.com/DragonDescentZerotsu/BCI-contest) is some code for you to refer to. ðŸ˜Ž
4. For students in Professor Wu's class, *Huamn-Computer Interactions*, doing **SSVEP** project, [here](https://github.com/DragonDescentZerotsu/SSVEP) is the version that scores 97 ðŸ¥³
